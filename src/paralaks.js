          shows a list of items (hits = Hacker News articles). The state and
          state update function come from the state hook called useState that is
          responsible to manage the local state for the data that we are going
          to fetch for the App component. The initial state is an empty list of
          hits in an object that represents the data. No one is setting any
          state for this data yet. We are going to use axios to fetch data, but
          it is up to you to use another data fetching library or the native
          fetch API of the browser. If you haven’t installed axios yet, you can
          do so by on the command line with npm instal l axios. Then implement
          your effect hook for the data fetching:
